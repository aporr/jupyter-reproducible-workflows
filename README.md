## Abstract

Attendees will be introduced to Jupyter notebooks and how they can be used to produce well-documented automated workflows using Python code.  We will walk through an existing Jupyter notebook that makes use of the popular Pandas data analysis and manipulation library (among others) and its geographic extensions (i.e. GeoPandas) to retrieve geographic data and attribute data from the Census website, integrate the retrieved data, and perform a simple common analysis task using the data.  We anticipate that attendees will already have experience downloading, integrating, and analyzing Census data using other tools (e.g., data.census.gov, Excel, ArcGIS), therefore this presentation will focus on the automation of this workflow using Jupyter and the efficiency, transparency, and reproducibility benefits that can be realized from this strategy.  All of tools demonstrated during the presentation will be free and open source, and the notebook will be made available so that attendees can experiment with the workflow after the presentation.  Basic familiarity with Python or other programming languages is beneficial to understand the workflow implementation, but not necessary to appreciate the primary learning objectives.

## Competency areas

This presentation will align with the following competency goals:

  1.	Foster Collaboration – Compared to manual analyses, the automated, reproducible workflows described in this presentation allow regional data creators to more clearly communicate their methodology to other users or even hand off the code itself so that other users can make use of it for their own purposes.

  2.	Capacity Building & Education – Although programmatic data analysis is becoming more commonplace, some analysts may resort to manual analyses due to lack of understanding of programmatic tools.  This presentation will provide a gentle introduction to a few programmatic analysis tools and reasons why analysts might want to learn to use them.

  3.	Governance & Practices – Manual analyses inherently lack transparency and reproducibility unless they are documented in excruciating detail.  Implementation of programmatic workflows inherently implements certain data best practices and reduces barriers to the implementation of others.

  4.	Data Procurement & Development – No significant alignment.

  5.	Digital Equity & Broadband Infrastructure – No significant alignment

  6.	Data Access, Inclusion & Equity – By using exclusively web-based and open-source tools, anyone with access to a web browser and Internet access can make use of the presented content without additional cost barriers.  The notebook interface also provides some accessibility benefits for people with visual and motor control disabilities compared to graphical user interfaces such as those used by ArcGIS.
